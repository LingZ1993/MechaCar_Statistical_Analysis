## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<img src="screenshot/Deliverable 1- Linear Regression.png">

Answering following questions: 
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
 - vehicle weight(0.0776)
 - spoiler angle(0.3069)
 - AWD(0.1852)
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 - The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is less than 0.05.
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
